# Random-Player-Generator
A website i created that generates mock basketball players at random, complete with fake names and statistics tailored to their respective positions.
For this website i used Bootstrap 4 to postion the containers for the images and data coming through.
I also used Jquery to call on an API with Ajax (https://randomuser.me/) for generating the name the names of each player.
